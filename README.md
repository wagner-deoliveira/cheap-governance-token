This project, at the beginning, has the purpose to be a learning point in how to write and deploy a governance token with Solidity. 

Secondly, this must been reviewed and implemented using the [cheapETH blockchain](https://cheapethereum.org/) since high gas fees sucks...

For this purpose, [Hard Hat](https://hardhat.org/) has been added to the original project.
